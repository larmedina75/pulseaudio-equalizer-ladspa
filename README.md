# pulseaudio-equalizer-ladspa
A LADSPA based multiband equalizer approach for getting better sound out of pulseaudio.
This equalizer clearly is more potent than the (deprecated ?), optional one from Pulseaudio.

## Differences
  * Add a failcheck when the equalizer sink is loaded
  * Add more presets (useful presets, ex. Bass Boost)
  * Enhaced Save Preset
  * Add Export preset 
  * Add Import presets

## Todo

  * About dialog
