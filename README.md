# Pulseaudio Equalizer
A LADSPA based multiband equalizer approach for getting better sound out of PulseAudio.
This equalizer clearly is more potent and easy to use than previous versions.

I like to play Spotify or other audio sources and get a good sound. Other equalizers work great but it uses Gnome 3 header bar and I do really hate this header bars distribution, so I try to fix this, and I add some extra features.
