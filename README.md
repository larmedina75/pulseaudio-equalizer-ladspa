# Pulseaudio Equalizer
A LADSPA based multiband equalizer approach for getting better sound out of pulseaudio.
This equalizer clearly is more potent and easy to use than prepious versions.

I like to play Spotify or other audio source and get a good sound. Other equalizers works grate but use only Gnome 3 header bar and I do really hate this header bars distribution, so I try to fix this and add some extra featues. 

## Features on version 2021.10

  * Export a preset 
  * Import a preset
  * Gnome 3 header bar enable / disable
  * Option to hav a traditional interface (menu and tool-bar, yeah I do hate header bars)
  * Save modified frecuencies set as a new preset
  * Delete local conf. presets
  * Enhanced Save Preset
  * About dialog and credits
  * Equilizer polished inteface

## Todo

  * Automatically detect non Gnome 3 Destop environments 
  * Export all user presets
  * Enabled import presets by drag and drop a .preset file
