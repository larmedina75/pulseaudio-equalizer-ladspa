# Pulseaudio Equalizer
A LADSPA based multiband equalizer approach for getting better sound out of pulseaudio.
This equalizer clearly is more potent than the (deprecated ?), optional one from Pulseaudio.

I like to play Spotify or other audio source and get a good sound. Other equalizers works grate but use only Gnome 3 header bar and I do hate this header bars, so I try to fix this and add some extra featues. 

## Features on version 2021.10

  * Gnome 3 Header bar enable / disable
  * Option to traditional Menu and tool-bar interface
  * Save modified frecuencies set as new a new preset
  * Delete local conf. presets
  * Enhanced Save Preset
  * About dialog and credits

## Todo

  * Automatically detect non Gnome 3 Destop environments 
  * Expot all user presets
  * Add Export preset 
  * Add Import preset
  * Enabled import presets by drag and drop a .preset files
